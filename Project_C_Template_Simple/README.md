Answer the following questions by put a "x" in the bracket.
- Yes [x], No []: Complete pre-lab
- Yes [x], No []: Complete basic lab requirements
- Yes [x], No []: Complete something cool
  - If you have completed something cool, give it a short summary below: 
I wrote a simple PWM program. it's not that cool but I got to pulse the light instead of just turning on an off (even though it is just turning on and off really fast).

Answers to Pre-lab Questions
-------
This part is required only if you are requested to write your answers here. 

* Question 1:
b Mask = 0x10 Value = 0x05
c Mask = 0x11 Valye = 0x05
* Question 2:
a Mask 0x00 Value = 0x0D
b Mask 0x01 Value = 0x00

Answers to After-lab Questions
-------

* Question 1:
the hardware debounce is small RC circuit, that adds a slight delay as well as "absorbs" other potential small pushes in the discharge of the capacitor

* Question 2:
The way I do it is I add a small delay after the button is pushed, this allows time for other potential "bounces" from being detected.

* Question 3:

* Question 4:
Low speed is good for LEDs because first of all, the human eye can't tell the difference between a 10mHz led and an 80mHz, so why waste energy on keeping an
LED lit if we can't see the difference between them?
